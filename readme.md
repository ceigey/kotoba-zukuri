## Goal
Language and Conlang organisational tool (ideally it should be able to do both, unless something goes horribly, _horribly_ wrong)

## Strategy
### Back-End
* Either JavaScript or C
* Make things modular, so you can plug in all sorts of weird binaries
### Front-End
* JavaScript + HTML5 + React + Modified Bootstrap?
* Wrap it all up in Electron.js
* ???
* Profit!
